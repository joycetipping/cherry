Here's how to replace the blog name/blog description text with an image.

1. Make a PNG image, name it "header.png" and upload it to the /wp-content/themes/apricot/images/ folder.  It should be 800px wide by 130px tall, or less.

2. Replace the original Apricot theme's header.php file with the header.php file from this folder.
