Cherry is the wordpress theme I use on my blog:
http://joycetipping.com/lifeblog

It is derived from Apricot, by Ardamis.com. I went in intending
to change a few colors and ended up rewriting the entire
stylesheet as well as tweaking most of the template files in some
way or another. So it's difficult for me to say that Cherry is a
child theme of Apricot. However, there's a big difference between
tweaking a theme and writing one from scratch, so the bulk of the
credit, as well as my personal gratitude, goes to the original
author.

If you like Cherry, you are free to use it. However, I don't
pretend that it's production ready. There are several places
where I hardcoded links to parts of my website outside of
Wordpress. I also have no idea whether my new stylesheet is IE
compatible.
