Cherry is the wordpress theme I use on my blogs:

It is derived from Apricot, by Ardamis.com. I went in intending
to change a few colors and ended up rewriting the entire
stylesheet as well as tweaking most of the template files in some
way or another. So it's difficult for me to say that Cherry is a
child theme of Apricot. However, there's a big difference between
tweaking a theme and writing one from scratch, so the bulk of the
credit, as well as my personal gratitude, goes to the original
author.

If you like Cherry, you are free to use it. You'll need to
manually uncomment the generic header and footer sections (in
header.php and footer.php) and comment out my custom sections. I
also have no idea whether my new stylesheet is IE compatible.
